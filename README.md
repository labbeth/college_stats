# Streamlit App: Data Analysis and Visualization

This Streamlit app allows users to upload CSV or Excel files and generate insightful visualizations, including:
- Bar plots for categorical variables.
- Scatter plot for numerical variables.
- Word clouds for free-text columns with support for n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams).

The app dynamically handles free-text columns, links them to related categorical plots, and ensures clear and interactive visualizations.
